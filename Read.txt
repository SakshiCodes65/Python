Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 
In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among 
sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.

In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among 
sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a 
single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence 
called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several 
important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s 
thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and 
directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader
of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will 
discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few 
sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and 
perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best 
to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of 
the paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective 
to place another sentence before the topic sentence—
for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph 
to the previous one, or one providing background information.
